To use Cjdns networking, follow these steps:

1)  Paste ipv4 peers into ~/cjdns/cjdns_peers_ipv4 or
paste ipv6 peers into ~/cjdns/cjdns_peers_ipv6.

2)  Use the Cjdns controller to write either ipv4
or ipv6 peers into the file /etc/cjdroute.conf.

3)  Use the Cjdns controller to start Cjdns.

4)  Return to conventional networking, if desired,
by selecting "Stop CJDNS" in the controller.

MOFO Linux comes with a large amount of peer data
scraped from multiple web sites.  You only need a few
for successful networking, but it is possible to use
many to assure connectivity in a contested networking
environment.
