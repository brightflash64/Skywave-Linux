<h2><i>Software Defined Radio for Global Online Listening</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Release Date:  02/08/2018.</p>

<p>Skywave Linux is an operating system using bleeding-edge technology
to robustly access broadcast, utility, military, and  amateur radio signals from almost anywhere
in the world, including countries with restrictive internet environments.  Skywave Linux connects
to a large and growing network of state-of-the art software defined radio (SDR) servers, making
it possible to experience high performance SDR operation without your own large antennas or
on-site radio hardware.  All you need to do is boot the system on a computer with internet 
connectivity. Skywave Linux can also operate numerous types of SDR hardware, plugged in or 
on the local network.  Downloading, installing and configuring SDR software can be difficult
for many computer users; Skywave Linux eliminates the hassle by including several applications
installed, configured, and ready to run.
</p>

<h3>Supported SDR Types</h3>
<p>Several types of software defined radios are supported by Skywave Linux:</p>

<ol>
     <li><a href="http://websdr.org/">WebSDR</a> servers are located all over the world
and provide easy access to the global airwaves through the web browser.  In Skywave Linux, use the
application called <b>WebSDR and OpenWebRX Servers</b> to call up the best servers.  A modern web browser
is all one needs to enjoy clean, stable, AM / FM / SSB reception using this cutting edge technology.
Servers at the <a href="http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/">University of Twente (NL)</a> and
<a href="http://www.160m.net/">G4FPH, Stafford (UK)</a> are particularly good.</li>
     <li><a href="http://sdr.hu/">OpenWebRX</a> servers are a new type of internet accessible
SDR, growing rapidly in number.  Use the <b>WebSDR and OpenWebRX Servers</b> application to access several excellent
sites around the world, such as <a href="http://kiwisdr.ece.uvic.ca:8073/">Victoria, British Columbia (Canada)</a>,
<a href="http://64.136.200.36:8073/">Overland Park, Kansas (USA)</a> or
<a href="http://travelx.org:8073/">Chiba, Japan</a>.  OpenWebRX is installed in Skywave Linux and capable of
running RTL-SDR and other hardware.</li>
     <li><a href="http://www.ab9il.net/software-defined-radio/rtl2832-sdr.html">RTL-SDR</a>
devices used on the local system. Just plug-and-play!
<a href="http://cubicsdr.com/">CubicSDR</a> and <a href="http://gqrx.dk/">Gqrx</a> are the main 
applications for receiving AM / FM / SSB modes.
<a href="http://napan.ca/ghpsdr3/index.php/Main_Page">QtRadio</a> (via the RTL-SDR controller script) offers
advanced noise reduction and very high quality AM / SSB / CW reception, plus FM up to a 200 kHz bandwidth.
<a href="https://github.com/mutability/dump1090">Dump1090</a>
(Mutability version) is for monitoring aircraft ADS-B transmissions.  ADS-B mapping is
available from Dump1090's built in webserver.  ADS-B data is also
logged to a log file for further analysis if desired. 
<a href="https://github.com/TLeconte/acarsdec">ACARSDec</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/szpajder/dumpvdl2">DumpVDL2</a> are multichannel decoders for aeronautical
VHF data modes.  Each is capable of <i>simultaneously monitoring up to eight channels at once</i> without
scanning and also logging the data to an SQL compatible file.
<a href="https://github.com/szpajder/RTLSDR-Airband">RTLSDR-Airband</a> is a multichannel monitor for AM or FM voice modes (not limited to airband), capable of <i>simultaneously monitoring eight channels without
scanning</i>, mixing and streaming audio to the internet via an Icecast server.</li>
     <li><a href="https://www.ettus.com/">Ettus Research USRP</a> devices, offering advanced features and high
performance.  Their hardware can cover frequencies from DC through 6 GHz in a diverse array of signal modes.</li>
     <li><a href="http://openhpsdr.org/">HPSDR</a> hardware, for internet accessible
receivers, is covered by <a href="http://napan.ca/ghpsdr3/index.php/Main_Page">QtRadio</a>.
Several servers, operated by volunteers around the world, are online 24 hours a day, and cover spectrum from LF
through low VHF.  Performance is excellent from these servers, and the radio configuration options
in QtRadio make for a "professional grade" operating experience.  To find servers, use the menu: Receiver > Quick
Server List.  This application works best with broadband internet.</li>
     <li><a href="http://sdranywhere.com/SDRanywhere/SDRanywhere.html">RemoteSDRClient</a> connects to
a network of shared <a href="http://www.rfspace.com">RFSPACE</a> SDRs.  These are high performance radios,
with advanced filtering and noise reduction software.  Like the shared HPSDRs mentioned above, they require
broadband internet connectivity for smooth operation.</li>
     <li><a href="http://www.sdrplay.com/">SDRplay</a>, <a href="http://airspy.com/">Airspy</a>, and
<a href="http://nuand.com/">BladeRF</a> offer higher performance than RTL-SDR dongles.  These devices feature stable and
clean oscillators, sensitive front end circuitry, superior RF filters, broader RF bandwidths, and higher resolution
ADC chipsets.  CubicSDR and Gqrx are the applications built for running these devices.</li>
</ol>

<p>For decoding RTTY, CW, PSK, WSPR, WSJT, RDS, and other digital radio transmission modes, the
<a href="http://www.w1hkj.com/">Fldigi</a>, <a href="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/">WSJT</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/windytan/redsea/blob/master/README.md">Redsea</a> applications are installed.
These decode audio from the local or remote receivers, or in the case of Redsea, directly tunes a local SDR
and decodes data.  Weather satellite decoding is possible with the very capable
<a href="http://www.wxtoimg.com">WXtoImg</a> application.  <a href="http://gpredict.oz9aec.net">Gpredict</a>
provides real-time satellite tracking data and doppler corrected tuning control for Gqrx. In some cases it may
be necessary to use the Pavucontrol application to select the best audio source (output from the LADSPA audio
processor plugins).  Trunked radio systems may be monitored using 
<a href="https://github.com/DSheirer/sdrtrunk/wiki">SDRTrunk</a>.
</p>

<p>Conventional radio and video broadcast streams are also supported in Skywave Linux.
<a href="https://kodi.tv" target="_blank">Kodi Media Center</a> provides access to <i>thousands</i>
of music, talk, news, free-speech, and religious stations around the world.  Editable playlists of 
IPTV and IPRADIO stations are located in the home folder.
</p>

<p>Use Skywave Linux as you would use any live Linux system:<p>
<ol>
     <li>In Windows, create a bootable USB or SD card using
<a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/">
Universal USB Installer</a>.</li>
     <li>In Linux, create a bootable USB or SD card using <a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/using-unetbootin-to-create-a-linux-usb-from-linux/">Unetbootin</a> or 
<a href="https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu">Startup Disk Creator</a>.</li>
     <li>Run it as a virtual machine under Virtualbox or VMware</li>
     <li>In Linux, simply install a <a href="https://www.ab9il.net/linux/grub2-iso-booting.html">bootloader and copy the
iso file</a> to a USB or SD card.</li>
     <li>Install it to the hard drive as the main operating system.</li>
     <li>Burn it to a DVD and run it as a boot disc (slow, avoid if possible).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Technical Notes</h3>
<p>Skywave Linux is a 64 bit system, built on a base of <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/features">Ubuntu 16.04 LTS</a>, 
uses the MATE desktop environment, and draws on the capabilities of Ubuntu:  software updating, 
graphics, system resource management, etc.  It is the additional digital signal processing,
networking, and signal decoding applications that set Skywave Linux apart from stock Ubuntu
Linux.  The default username is <b><i>skywave</i></b> and there is no password in the default
system.
</p>

<p>The radio software is largely compiled from source code and can be updated by end users
with moderate computer skills, though Skywave Linux is designed for easy use by radio
operators with basic computer skills.  In fact, a key goal of Skywave Linux is to open the
world of HPSDR and RTL-SDR operating to people who enjoy high performance radio but are
not computer experts.
</p>

<p>It may sometimes be advantageous for users to use encrypted connections which provide 
stronger privacy, security, and ability to circumvent censorship.  For that purpose, the 
<a href="https://getlantern.org/">Lantern</a>
and <a href="https://psiphon.ca/">Psiphon</a> applications are installed.  In addition, 
basic OpenVPN and L2TP/IPSec connections are supported.
</p>
